# Zohar Asulin page

I recently got to know [Gabor Szabo](https://github.com/szabgab/) through a shared colleague. Luckily, he invited me to join his course [OSDC - Open Source Development Course](https://osdc.code-maven.com/), where I learned how to create github pages using my github repository.

I'm a data scientist in goverment office,At the same time I am a master's student at the Azrieli College of Engineering.
I am currently building my academic page, also using github pages. I used a theme for academic purposes and it looks great .
